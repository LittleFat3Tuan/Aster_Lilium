# Analyzing Lilium fitness with Aster model


## About this project

This project studies how distance-dependent processes influence *Lilium philadelphicum* reproductive fitness in western Minnesota, with [aster modeling technique](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/94/2/415/224189). This project is still on-going(so data is not posted here) and this repo houses my work on it so far.

## Aster model

Aster model is a "generalized Generalized Linear Model".
